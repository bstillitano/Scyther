/// Manages network request interception and logging for the Scyther debugging framework.
///
/// `NetworkHelper` provides the core functionality for intercepting HTTP/HTTPS requests
/// made by the application. It registers a custom `URLProtocol` to capture all network
/// traffic and maintains configuration for filtering and caching.
///
/// ## Features
/// - Automatic request and response logging
/// - URL filtering to exclude specific endpoints
/// - Support for custom URL session configurations
/// - IP address resolution
/// - Content type filtering
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// // Start network logging (typically called once during app startup)
/// NetworkHelper.instance.start()
///
/// // Ignore specific URLs
/// NetworkHelper.instance.ignoredURLs = ["https://analytics.example.com"]
///
/// // Access the device's IP address
/// let ip = await NetworkHelper.instance.ipAddress
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Network logging uses method swizzling to intercept `URLSession` requests.
@MainActor
public final class NetworkHelper: Sendable {
    /// Private Init to Stop re-initialisation and allow singleton creation.
    private nonisolated init() {}

    /// An initialised, shared instance of the `NetworkHelper` class.
    /// Note: nonisolated(unsafe) is required because this singleton is accessed from
    /// swizzled URLSessionConfiguration methods which run in a nonisolated context.
    /// The warning about this being unnecessary is incorrect for @MainActor classes.
    nonisolated(unsafe) static let instance = NetworkHelper()

    /// URLs that will not be logged or intercepted by Scyther.
    ///
    /// Add URL prefixes to this array to exclude them from network logging.
    /// Useful for preventing infinite loops or excluding analytics/telemetry endpoints.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// NetworkHelper.instance.ignoredURLs = [
    ///     "https://analytics.example.com",
    ///     "https://telemetry.example.com"
    /// ]
    /// ```

    /// The current IP address of the device.
    ///
    /// This property asynchronously fetches the device's public IP address using the ipify API.
    /// The result is cached after the first **successful** fetch, and every caller that arrives
    /// while a fetch is still in flight shares it. A failure is shared but not cached, so the
    /// next caller tries again.
    ///
    /// Coalescing is not an optimisation. ``hasResolvedIPAddress`` used to be set only *after*
    /// the `await` returned, so the flag was still `false` for the whole round trip and every
    /// caller that arrived in that window started a request of its own. A menu that was re-created
    /// once a second — which is what a modal presented over it does — therefore fired one lookup
    /// per second for as long as the first one was outstanding. The in-flight ``Task`` closes that
    /// window: it is recorded before the first suspension point, so a second caller finds it and
    /// awaits the same result.
    ///
    /// ## Example
    /// ```swift
    /// let ip = await NetworkHelper.instance.ipAddress
    /// print("Device IP: \(ip)")
    /// ```

            /// second caller can interleave between the check and the store. That is the whole
