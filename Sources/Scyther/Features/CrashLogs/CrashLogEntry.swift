/// A model representing a captured crash or exception.
///
/// `CrashLogEntry` contains all information captured when an uncaught exception
/// occurs, including the exception details, stack trace, and environment metadata.
///
/// ## Properties
///
/// Each crash entry includes:
/// - Exception name and reason
/// - Full stack trace symbols
/// - App version and build number at time of crash
/// - iOS version and device model
/// - Precise timestamp
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```swift
/// let crashes = CrashLogger.instance.allCrashes
/// for crash in crashes {
///     print("Crash: \(crash.name)")
///     print("Reason: \(crash.reason ?? "Unknown")")
///     print("Date: \(crash.formattedTimestamp)")
/// }
///
/// // Generate a shareable report
/// let report = crashes.first?.fullReport
/// ```
///
/// ## Conformances
/// - `Identifiable`: Each crash has a unique UUID
/// - `Codable`: Crashes can be serialized for persistence
/// - `Equatable`: Crashes can be compared for equality
/// - `Sendable`: Safe to pass across actor boundaries
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Properties
/// - ``id``
/// - ``timestamp``
/// - ``name``
/// - ``reason``
/// - ``stackTrace``
/// - ``appVersion``
/// - ``buildNumber``
/// - ``osVersion``
/// - ``deviceModel``
///
/// ### Computed Properties
/// - ``formattedTimestamp``
/// - ``summary``
/// - ``fullReport``
